About the program:

Assumptions:
1. Finite many integer values of entries in the database
2. User does not enter more than one digit input to the login and continue prompts
3. No serialisation is needed as it is assumed that the program will be running throughout the lifetime of library

Limitations:
1. The indices of databases are taken to be int. So it is assumes that it falls in range covered by positive signed int.


How to run the program
1. Compile the C++ code
2. Create the database
3. Run the menu-selection routines

Files:
1. Assn1_b.cpp - having getters and setters
2. Assn1.cpp - bare program without getters and setters
3. Readme.md file (this file :) )
